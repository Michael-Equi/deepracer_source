Agreement. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. A Party that obtains a judgment 
against the other Party in the courts identified in this Section may enforce that judgment in any court that has 
jurisdiction over the Parties. 
23.	EXPORT REGULATIONS/EXPORT CONTROL. Licensee agrees that neither Licensee nor Licensee's subsidiaries 
will export/re-export the Software, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the U.S. Department of Commerce or 
any other agency or department of the U.S. Government or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires 
an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining any such required license or approval. In the 
event the Software is exported from the U.S.A. or re-exported from a foreign destination by Licensee or Licensee's 
subsidiary, Licensee will ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the Software complies with all 
laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign 
government. 
24.	GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Software is a commercial item (as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101) 
consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation (as those terms are 
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, Licensee will 
not provide the Software to the U.S. Government. Contractor or Manufacturer is Intel Corporation, 2200 Mission College 
Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054.
25.	 ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of 
Licensee's rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt to do 
so, without Intel's express prior written consent, will be null and void.  If Licensee transfers possession or control of the 
Software (including any modifications or portions thereof) or transfer any rights granted under this Agreement to a third 
party, this license will automatically terminate without notice.  Intel may assign, delegate and transfer this Agreement, 
and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion. For the purposes of this Section, a change in the persons 
or entities that directly or indirectly control fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity securities or beneficial or voting 
interest of Licensee will be considered an assignment by Licensee and will require Intel's prior written consent.
26.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, any NDA, and any IPLA with 
Intel constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and 
supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither Party will 
be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to the 
subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided herein. In the event any provision of this Agreement is 
unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will 
not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be changed and interpreted 
so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within legal limits.  In the event of any inconsistency between 
the terms of this Agreement and any agreements of Authorized Distributors, this Agreement will govern and control, 
except with regards to payment terms.
27.	WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will not affect 
the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision 
hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself. 
28.	PRIVACY. LICENSEE'S PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN INTEL'S PRIVACY NOTICE, WHICH FORMS A PART 
OF THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE REVIEW THE PRIVACY NOTICE AT HTTP://WWW.INTEL.COM/PRIVACY TO LEARN HOW 
INTEL COLLECTS, USES AND SHARES INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSEE.
